# SFTI Guidelines and Coding Style
At the [SFTI Wiki](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki) you can find information about SFTI's API design principles, collaboration and implementation guidelines. If you contribute on API specifications, please pay special attention to SFTI's [style guide](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki/Style-Guide-Common-APIs) and [naming conventions](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki/Naming-Conventions). Make sure you are familiar with both guidelines before submitting your PR, as there are special GitHub Actions implemented that check the rules automatically. PR that do not pass all checks cannot be considered in the SFTI standard.
